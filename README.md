# ios-widgets-tutorial
A project to practice and demonstrate functionality of iOS WidgetKit framework and SwiftUI

## Description

This project is intended to be used to explore the iOS WidgetKit framework and assist others in learning how to develop for iOS widgets. To do this, a time widget to show the current time in an asethetically pleasing way on the home screen is developed. This allows for exploration into widget view content development, intent configurations, and timeline providers.
